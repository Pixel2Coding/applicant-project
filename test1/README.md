# BranchLabs Applicant Project

The BranchLabs applicant project involves implementing a basic ORM in PHP and then integrating it with Magento. Yes, you'll be duplicating functionality already provided by Magento, but that's okay.

The project generally takes folks around 4 hours.

If you run into any questions while reviewing the documentation or implementing the project, feel free to send your interviewer an email.

## Part I. Abstract Model

Subjects tested:
  * OO Concepts
  * MySQL
  * CRUD
  * Object-relational mapping

In this folder you will find
  * `Contact.php` - File with code to be used for testing
  * `contacts.sql` - Test data
  * `contact_test.php` - Unit tests

There is a class in `Contact.php` that extends a parent class called `AbstractModel`. You will need to build this abstract class.

To develop `AbstractModel`, you will need to:
* Import `contacts.sql` into a MySQL database
* Write `AbstractModel.php`
* Confirm `contacts_test.php` runs correctly.

* REQUIRED METHODS
  * `public function save()`
  * `public function load($id)`
  * `public function delete($id=false)`
  * `public function getData($key=false)`
  * `public function setData($arr, $value=false)`
  
You will need to make database calls in these methods. Please use the PHP MySQL adapter of your choice.

**NOTE**: You do not need to make `AbstractModel` work with composite keys. Assume all models extending from this table use a single primary key.

## Part II. Framework

Subjects tested:
* MVC
* Magento Exposure

Using Magento 1 or 2, incorporate the abstract model into a simple application. Like mentioned above, even though Magento already has an ORM, try integrating this simple one with Magento and using it too. Feel free to rename the classes to make them work better within Magento.

Application guidelines:
* Must have a URL where a contact's information is visibleâ€”something like example.com/contact/view/id/[some_id]
* Must use the Contact model shown above to load the record.

If you have extra time, feel free to add extra bits of polish.

## Part III. Submission

Once you've completed the project, submit a pull request on this project with your implementation and shoot us an email back. Let your interview what you thought about the project, and any issues or questions you had while working on it. Context and communication is important on a remote team!
